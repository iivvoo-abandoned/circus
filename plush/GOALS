hash/gosh/gish/whatever

I try to implement a hush-like package built upon tcl/tk (8.0)
Hush has a nice interface, but it's slow, buggy, poorly documented,
and every new release is a pain to port to linux.

I do not try to re-invent the wheel, my first goal is to be compatible
enough to compile cIRCus, after that, all kinds of goodies can be 
added (i.e. tix)

Also, it's not my goal to make a perfect 1-1 match between C++ and tcl/tk,
I use tcl/tk as underlying toolkit, but I may add functionality that is
not supported in in tcl/tk (and the other way around, I may not define
C++ equivalents for each tcl/tk option/procedure, etc).

Some of the goals are:

- Speed
- Stability
- Portability
- Extendibility

Other features that Hush lacks >:)
