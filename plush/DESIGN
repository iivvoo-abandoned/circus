Internally, we use cstring for stringmanipulation. But use standard
char * for stringcommunication with the outside world (people should
be free to choose their own stringclass, after all)

The inheritancetree should be quite like Hush's (well, I assume).
Avoid multiple inheritance, as C++ handles multiply defined methods
with errors and difficulty

KitObject - Handler - Widget - Button
	       |	     - Listbox
	       |	       (etc)
	       +----- Session - Application

Should kit.[ch] and KitObject.h be merged? They are rather dependend..

Generally, widgets can only be packed in frames or toplevels. Perhaps
make a separate class of these? 

class packable: public widget
{
..
}

However, this would require the widget constructor to take a 
widget(packable *, ..) as parent. Looks sloppy...

Actually, I just found out that tk ALLOWS widgets to be embedded in other
widgets! Try, for example,

	button .b
	entry .b.e
	pack .b
	pack .b.e

It gives weird results though :)
