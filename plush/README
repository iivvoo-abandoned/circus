Plush - Portable Lightweight Utility Shell
==========================================

What is Plush?
==============

Plush is a windowingtoolkit based upon tcl/tk and Tix. It offers
C++ programmers a nice powerfull api for these packages, including 
widgets, events, scripting, and more, such as garbage collection.

Plush's API is based upon Hush's API - Plush was written because something
compatible with Hush was needed, but faster, more stable and easier to
extend.

Why combine C++ with scripting?
===============================

Why not? tk/tix are very powerfull toolkits, so why reimplement all those
widgets? Embedding tcl scripting in your C++ applications also allows for
more configurability and extendibility of your applications (i.e. config
files with tcl syntax, or extensions using tk). This way, you take the
best of two worlds, the power of C++ and all it's available libraries,
and the power of tcl/tk/tix!

And for speed.. it's definately not slower than tcl/tk. If you're afraid
of the overhead, use assembly to do X calls >:)

Structure

To be documented later

Garbage Collection
==================

Plush's garbage collections is easy and compatible with hush's. New
widgets are usually created withing others (i.e. toplevels, frames, 
rootwindow). When a widget is created, it's 'registered' for collection
at it's parent. When the parent is destroyed, all registered childwidgets
are also destroyed. I.e. when a toplevel is destroyed, all components
withing the toplevel are also destroyed.

Though this is not pure garbage collections as java or lisp programmers
are used to, it does help the programmer somewhat.
