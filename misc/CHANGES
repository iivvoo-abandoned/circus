Changes since 0.30 (14-11-96)
-----------------------------
- Fixed 'Error in tcl-script' notices (added escape())
- Fixed /invite bug (comparing a cstring to NULL gives assertion error)
- Fixed 'No parameters on commandline' bug (it was just a too strict
  assertion in cstring)
- cIRCus suddenly stopped working with certain servers. It seems some servers
  end a message with \n, others with \r\n. This has been fixed.
- Efnet servers don't support channels longer than 50 characters. This means
  cIRCus used to crash on long channelnames. Now, circus trucates them after
  the 50th character (this might cause problem on undernet..
- Fixed /names bug.
- Added support for IRCLOGIN environment variable and .circusrc 'login'
  variable to set loginname.
- Servernotices now appear in the master window
- Removed usermode +s (which isn't supported in server >= 2.9.1, 
  added usermode +r
- cIRCus now handles serverops better
- Improved (?) servercode. It now accepts messages separated by \r\n and \n
- Reconnecting to a new server should work!
- The helpbutton launches the new help application
  (clicking it too fast might start more than one though :(
  - this help application (cIRCle) is not (yet?) available under Linux
- If away, the awaymessage is shown in the title of the masterwindow
- Added histentry - an entry with history facilities, and used it for the
  inputentry
- Pasting in the inputentry should work. Sort off. It's a kludge

Changes since 0.31 (25-11-96)
-----------------------------
- Internal rewrites, cIRCus should be a tiny little bit faster
- Rejoin (1x) after kick
- Removed stupid, annoying behaviour in entry widget which makes typed text
  disappear if you remove your mousepointer.
- Added serverlist which stores servers+portnumbers
- Fixed not-online bug. If a user is not online, it is reported in the
  query window (if any)
- Added keybindings to allow insertion of ^B ^V ^_ and ^O
- Added inputentries to channel and query windows. People want them,
  they get them. *sigh*
- Lots of ctcp improvements
- Serverlist is now complete - you can define a complete list of servers
  and portnumbers in your .circusrc., or set the IRCSERVER environment
  variable
- Added some extra numerics (442, 250)
- Rewrote entry-pasting stuff. The old solution did not work. The current one
  isn't very elegant (newlines are inserted as '\n'), but it works.

Changes since 0.32 (01-12-96)
-----------------------------
- Started working on DCC code. DCC chat works fine, thought it's hard to
  control (i.e. no way to close connection currently).
- Fixed bug in combobox in reconnect dialog window. Portnumber was messed
  up.
- Fixed bug in join-code. If a user joins a channel, and is opped by the 
  server, the server reports this as channel^Go. cIRCus forgot to remove the
  ^Go when displaying the join message
- /server newhost did not update the serverentry in the masterwindow. Now
  it does.
- cIRCus didn't convert commands to lower case -> LEAVE does not work :\
  - fixed
- Added LOAD command to load tcl scripts (the beginning of cIRCus scripting :)
- Added OPER command
- Added extra numerics for 'american efnet'
- cIRCus should understand channeltime stamps (both undernet and efnet)
- Support for the ^C colorattribute in messages, which was recenly introduced
  in the latest mIRC (4.7). Using ^Cx,y you can set the
  fore-/backgroundcolor.
- Added replies for TRACE command
- /msg someone that wasn't online made circus crash. - fixed (thnx pino666)
- fixed wrong error when /inviting someone with a channel
  (i.e. /invite vladdrac #cIRCus) - Thanx pino :)
- Added 2 very simple scripting commands. Have a look at 'finger.tcl'
  to get an impression. Type the following commands:

  /query somenick
  click chatbutton and wait for establish
  /load finger
  /finger =somenick
  /circus =somenick
  /okay =somenick

  You can also query yourself to see the result! :)

Changes since 0.40 (13-01-97)
-----------------------------
- The usage of the USER command now complies to RFC1459 - hopefully servers
  won't see cIRCus as a bot anymore :)
- DCC fixes
- cIRCus now follows nickchanges (which involved a tiny internal redesign)
- Input focus/entry show-hide is handled differently
  (I actually planned something with timeouts but I don't think it would be
  very efficient)
- Added umode command
- Added some missing numerics (408, INFO replies)
- The ircnet channelsize limit shouldn't be a problem anymore (neither should
  a tcl 'raw "JOIN #channel" be, anymore)
- Dumped that stupid (*&(* libsocket and used my own network io-class.
  Works fine, have to fix errorreporting though
- Changed the displaying of nicknames in query/messagewindows. In querywindows,
  messages sent get the senders nickname (yours that is), in messagewindows,
  messages sent get the targets nickname.
- Fixed the 'channels-with-a-.-bug'. Windowpathnames are now independent
  of the channelnames
- You can now select 1 or more users in your messagewindow and reply to them.
  This means you don't have to start a query to send a simple respons, or
  type /msg. 

Changes since 0.41 (06-02-97)
-----------------------------
- a ` is legal in nicknames, so is | (rfc1459 really sucks)
- New channelwindows should have focus bij default.
- If you join a channel, then this is noted in the window
- Added options to automatically raise/deiconify window on output
- AWAY info is reset after server reconnect
- serverreconnect works!
- nick can be changed when not connected
- Added some more info to the window title
- Fixed bug - cIRCus crashed if you join a locked channel
- DCC fixed - the wrong ip (127.0.0.1) was sent on connections over
  dynamic ip
- cIRCus accepts two commandline options:
  -d sets the debuglevel, i.e. -d 5
  -f resourcefile points to the resourcescript to be loaded, i.e. -f system.rc
  furthermore, cIRCus searches standard directories for global circusrc scripts:
                  char    *locs[] = {
                  "/usr/local/circus/system.circusrc",
                  "/usr/circus/system.circusrc",
                  "/usr/local/lib/circus/system.circusrc",
                  "/usr/lib/circus/system.circusrc",
                   NULL
                  };
- Created a fileselector, which is now used for the /load command, and 
  will be used for dcc uploads/downloads.
- Added extra .circurc variable 'scriptdir' and 'dccdownloaddir'
- The textwidget should beep once per line if it contains beeps
- Removed the scrollock button again - the widget automatically locks
  if the scrollbar has the mousecursor! :)
- renamed -d and -f to -debug and -file, -d clashes with -display
- Lots of DCC fixes. Abort works, up/downloads work, filerrors are reported
  (upto a certain level - disk full etc is not detected). Mostly quick hacks
  because I want to ship 0.42.

Changes since 0.42 (09-05-97)
-----------------------------
- The static version now only has tcl/tk static, because of problems with
  my libc and hostnameresolving
- Commented out too much code, causing cIRCus not to send unknown commands to
  the server
- Added keybindings Control-N and Control-P to histentry to go back/forward
  in history
- Added binding Control-U to script scripts/key.tcl
- Added script variable 'signoff' to set the default signoff message
- Added Jan Harkes' patches for Irix

Changes since 0.43 (01-06-97)
